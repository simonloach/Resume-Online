about:
  summary: |
    I'm Simon, and I work with technology to solve problems. Every day I seem to discover a new version of what kind of engineer I am. Started as Software, evolved to Operations, then DevOps, Platform, Monitoring, Kubernetes, Cloud, Lead, Architect, Data Engineer, and now ML Systems Engineer. At this rate, I'll probably be a Quantum Blockchain AI Engineer by next Tuesday.
    
    I like building systems that work reliably at scale. Whether it's automating workflows, designing cloud architecture, or implementing ML pipelines, I focus on practical solutions that teams can actually maintain. I'm comfortable across the full stack - from network configs to distributed systems to ML model deployment.
    
    Currently fascinated by how ML/AI tooling is changing how we build and operate systems. Always learning, always building, always trying to make things work better than they did yesterday. Strong believer in automation, good documentation, and systems that don't wake you up at 3 AM.

        Being an Information and Communication Technologies student allows to be decently
        well versed in all areas of IT whilst extending that with knowledge about
        telecommucation and signals theory. Variety of topics of which this field

        of things - hosting game servers, providing failover connection etc. Generally
        had fun around technology.

        When I was 12 years old me and a friend of mine decided to create a
        Minecraft(a pretty popular game at that time) server hosting company. At the beggining
        we would host a server off of my parents attic on which we were selling virtual
        currecy, privilages etc.
        
        Later on as we scaled we moved to Hetzner VPS and started offering private
        servers for users. It was a great experience, learned a lot about software
        development (mostly Java). Had a chance to interact on the frontline as a
        forum moderator and in-game administrator. It was working really great for us with
        100-150 people on our servers on average during biggest hype moment for
        Minecraft. This was one of the greatest journeys I have ever experienced.

      Leading teams isn't about being the loudest voice in the room - it's about amplifying everyone else's. I focus on upskilling teammates, removing blockers, and creating environments where people can do their best work. Teaching how to solve problems while staying open to learning from everyone. The best code reviews are conversations, not lectures. Success means delivering value while keeping both engineers and business stakeholders happy.

      I listen, I think, and when I don't know something, I learn. Then I architect solutions - whether it's ETL pipelines, internal developer platforms, microservices, or public-facing web applications. Every problem is different, but the approach is the same: understand requirements, evaluate options, design pragmatically, implement iteratively. No ivory tower architecture - I stay hands-on and build alongside the team.

      I learn every day. One year ago, I barely understood ML beyond a university course I scraped through. Now I'm building ML systems in production. I thrive on new technologies and unfamiliar challenges. Give me a new framework, cloud service, or problem domain, and I'll prototype, experiment, and ship. Learning by doing is my superpower - whether it's Kubernetes, ML pipelines, or tomorrow's tech stack.
